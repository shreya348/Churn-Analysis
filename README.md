**Customer Churn Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis conducted on a dataset of over 6,000 customers. The primary objective of this analysis was to identify key factors driving customer churn and develop actionable strategies to improve customer retention. The analysis was performed using MS SQL Server for data cleaning, ETL processes, and data transformation, followed by creating interactive dashboards in Power BI for insightful visualizations.

**Key Insights & Analysis**

**Higher Churn for Month-to-Month Contracts:** The analysis revealed that customers on month-to-month contracts exhibited a 15% higher churn rate compared to those on longer-term contracts.

**Churn Analysis by Gender, Payment Method, and Service Category:** Interactive dashboards provide detailed breakdowns of churn across various factors such as gender, payment methods, service categories, and state.

**Service Type Impact:** Customers using fiber optic internet services had a 10% lower churn rate compared to those using cable services, showcasing the importance of service type on customer loyalty.

**Customer Segmentation:** Segmented customers based on demographics and service usage, identifying high-risk groups more likely to churn. This segmentation was pivotal in tailoring retention strategies.

**Retention Strategy Success:** By implementing targeted retention strategies focused on contract types, payment methods, and service offerings, churn was reduced by up to 12%, achieving a 20% higher retention rate for identified high-risk customers.

**Technologies Used**
